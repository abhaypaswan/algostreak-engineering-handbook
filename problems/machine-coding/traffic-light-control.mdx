Design a control system for a traffic light at an intersection that can switch between different states (green, yellow, red) based on traffic and pedestrian signals, keep track of traffic flow and timing, handle emergency vehicles, handle multiple intersections simultaneously, and have a management interface for monitoring the status and usage.

### Requirements:

1. Ability to switch between different traffic light states (green, yellow, red) based on traffic and pedestrian signals.
2. Tracking of traffic flow and timing of each light.
3. Emergency vehicle handling capability.
4. Ability to handle multiple intersections at the same time.

### Sample IO

```python
Traffic Light Control System

Main road traffic light: Green
Side road traffic light: Red

Input:
[Sensor detected] Vehicles and pedestrians approaching side road
[Management interface request] Emergency vehicle priority

Output:

Main road traffic light: Yellow
Side road traffic light: Red

Main road traffic li ght: Red
Side road traffic light: Green

Emergency vehicle has passed through the intersection.
Resuming normal traffic flow...

Main road traffic light: Green
Side road traffic light: Red
```
