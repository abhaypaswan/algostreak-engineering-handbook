### Problem Statement:

Design a control system for an elevator in a building that can move between floors, pick up and drop off passengers, and handle requests efficiently. The system should keep track of the elevator's location, status, and queue of requests and handle multiple requests simultaneously. Additionally, the system should be able to handle emergency stops in case of malfunctions.

The system should have an interface for the elevator operator to input and manage requests, as well as an interface for the building's management to monitor the elevator's status and usage. Your task is to design the algorithms and data structures necessary to ensure proper functioning of the elevator control system.

### Requirements:

1. Keep track of the elevator's location, status, and queue of requests.
2. Handle multiple requests efficiently.
3. Handle emergency stops in case of malfunctions.
4. Provide an interface for the elevator operator to input and manage requests.
5. Provide an interface for the building's management to monitor the elevator's status and usage.

### Example:

A passenger presses the button for the elevator on the 5th floor and requests to go to the 10th floor. The control system should receive the request, add it to the queue of requests, and determine the most efficient way to handle the request while also taking into account any other requests in the queue. The system should update the elevator's status to "in use" and move the elevator to the 5th floor to pick up the passenger. Once the passenger has entered, the system should update the elevator's destination to the 10th floor and move the elevator accordingly. The building's management should be able to access the interface to monitor the elevator's status, location, and usage.
