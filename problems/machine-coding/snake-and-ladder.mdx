### Requirements

1. The game should be played on a board with 100 squares, numbered from 1 to 100.
2. The player starts at square 1.
3. The player rolls a dice to move their game piece the number of squares indicated by the dice roll. The dice should have 6 sides and generate random numbers from 1 to 6.
4. If the player lands on a square with a ladder, they climb up the ladder to a higher square. There are multiple ladders in the game, each connecting two squares.
5. If the player lands on a square with a snake, they slide down to a lower square. There are multiple snakes in the game, each connecting two squares.
6. The game ends when the player reaches square 100. The code should print a message indicating that the player has won.

### **Additional Requirements**

1. The game should be able to support more than two players.
2. The game should allow for the use of more than one dice.

### Example

Here is an example of what a game of Snake and Ladder could look like:

```python
Rolling dice...
Player 1 rolled a 4.
Player 1 is now on square 5.

Rolling dice...
Player 2 rolled a 6.
Player 2 is now on square 11.

....

Rolling dice...
Player 1 landed on a ladder!
Player 1 is now on square 89.

Rolling dice...
Player 2 landed on a snake!
Player 2 is now on square 67.

....

Rolling dice...
Player 2 rolled a 3
Player 2 is now on square 91

Rolling dice...
Player 1 rolled a 5
Player 1 is now on square 100

Player 1 won!
```
