### Requirements:

- The game should be played on a 4x4 grid
- The player should be able to move tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- The player should be able to combine matching tiles by moving them in the same direction
- A new tile should be randomly generated with a value of either 2 or 4 after each player move
- The game should end when the player creates a tile with the value 2048 or when there are no more possible moves left
- The player's score should be displayed and updated after each move

### Sample Input/Output:

```python
... starting 2048 with random numbers
+----+----+----+----+
|  2 | 32 |  2 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+
| 16 |  0 |  8 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+
|  0 |  0 |  2 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+
|  0 |  0 |  2 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+
Score: 64

Down
+----+----+----+----+
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+
|  0 |  0 |  2 |  2 |
+----+----+----+----+
|  2 |  0 |  8 |  0 |
