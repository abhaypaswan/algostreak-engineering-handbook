Design a ride-sharing service like Uber that connects passengers with drivers for rides. The system should provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for both drivers and passengers, allow them to book rides, and manage their trip details. The service should be available 24/7 and be able to handle a large number of users.

### Example:

Suppose we need to build a ride-sharing service like Uber for a city with a population of 1 million people. The service should allow users to book rides in different types of vehicles, such as cars, SUVs, and vans. Users should be able to specify their pick-up and drop-off locations, and the service should provide estimated arrival times and fares for the trip. Drivers should be able to accept or reject ride requests and receive directions to the pick-up location.

### Functional Requirements:

- Passengers should be able to request a ride through the mobile app or website.
- Drivers should be able to view and accept ride requests.
- The system should provide real-time location tracking and estimated time of arrival (ETA) for passengers and drivers.
- The system should provide fare estimates and secure payment options for passengers.
- Passengers and drivers should be able to rate each other after each ride.
- The system should provide notifications to passengers and drivers about ride updates, including ride acceptance, driver arrival, and ride completion.
- Passengers and drivers should be able to view ride history and receipts.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users and ride requests.
- The system should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from errors.
- The system should provide high availability with minimal downtime.
- The system should provide secure authentication and authorization for passengers and drivers.
- The system should be able to handle real-time location tracking and provide accurate ETA predictions with minimal latency.

### Assumptions:

- Passengers and drivers are verified and authorized to use the service.
- Passengers and drivers have access to a compatible mobile device with GPS and internet connectivity.
- Passengers and drivers will comply with the terms and conditions of the service.
- Drivers have a valid driver's license and insurance.

### Estimated Usage:

- The system should be able to handle at least 1 million active passengers and drivers.
- The system should be able to handle at least 100,000 ride requests per hour.
