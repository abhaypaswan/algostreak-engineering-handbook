Design a system like Google Maps that allows users to view maps, get directions, and explore locations.

### Example:

Suppose we need to build a system like Google Maps for a travel website with millions of daily active users. Users should be able to view maps, get driving, walking, and public transportation directions between two points, and explore locations by searching for nearby businesses, landmarks, and attractions.

### Functional Requirements:

1. Users should be able to view maps of any location in the world.
2. Users should be able to search for locations by name, address, or category.
3. Users should be able to get driving, walking, and public transportation directions between two points.
4. Users should be able to view real-time traffic information and find the fastest route.
5. Users should be able to explore locations by viewing photos, reviews, and ratings.
6. Users should be able to save and share locations with others.
7. The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
8. The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle larger volumes of users.

### Non-functional Requirements:

1. The system should be highly available and accessible from anywhere in the world.
2. The system should be able to respond to user requests in real-time.
3. The system should be able to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.
4. The system should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from errors.
5. The system should provide strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Assumptions:

1. The system assumes that users have an internet connection and a web browser or mobile device to access the service.
2. The system assumes that users are authorized to use the service.
3. The system assumes that locations are publicly available and do not require special permissions to access.

### Estimated Usage:

1. The system should be able to handle at least 10 million daily active users.
2. The system should be able to handle at least 100,000 requests per second.
