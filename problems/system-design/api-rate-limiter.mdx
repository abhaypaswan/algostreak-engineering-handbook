Design a web API rate limiter that limits the number of requests an API client can make within a specific time period.

### Functional Requirements

- The API rate limiter should allow a limited number of requests for an API client within a specific time period.
- If the API client exceeds the allowed limit, the API should return an error response.
- The API should provide a way for API clients to check their current rate limit status.

### Nonfunctional Requirements

- 99.99% Availability
- 50ms latency for rate limit check API
- 100ms latency for rate limited API calls
- The rate limiter should work across multiple instances of the API service.

### Assumptions

- The API clients are identified using an API key or an IP address.
- The API service can handle up to 1 million active clients.
- The rate limit will be calculated per minute.
- The rate limit will be configurable on a per-client basis.

### Estimated Usage

- 500 requests per second during peak hours.
- 1 read and 1 write per rate limit check.
- 2000 rate-limited requests per second during peak hours.
