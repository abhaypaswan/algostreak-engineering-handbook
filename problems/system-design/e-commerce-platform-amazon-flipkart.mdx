The system should also provide features like reviews, ratings, and recommendations to help users make informed purchasing decisions.

### Functional Requirements:

- Users should be able to browse products by category, price, and other attributes.
- Users should be able to search for products using keywords and other search criteria.

- The system should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from errors.
- The system should be able to run continuously with minimum downtime.
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of transactions without impacting performance.
- The system should provide strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Assumptions:

- The system assumes that sellers are verified and authorized to sell products on the platform.
- The system assumes that products comply with local laws and regulations.
