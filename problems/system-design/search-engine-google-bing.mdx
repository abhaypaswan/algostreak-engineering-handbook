Design a search engine like Google that can handle a large number of user queries and provide relevant search results quickly and accurately.

### Example:

Suppose we need to build a search engine like Google that can handle 100 million daily search queries. Users should be able to search for web pages, images, videos, and news articles using keywords and other search criteria. The system should be able to rank search results based on relevance and popularity, and it should provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

### Functional Requirements:

1. Users should be able to search for web pages, images, videos, and news articles using keywords and other search criteria.
2. The search engine should be able to provide relevant search results quickly and accurately.
3. The search engine should be able to rank search results based on relevance and popularity.
4. The search engine should be able to handle a large number of concurrent user queries.
5. The search engine should be able to index and store a large number of web pages, images, videos, and news articles.
6. The search engine should be able to detect and filter out spam and low-quality content.
7. The search engine should be able to handle complex queries, such as Boolean operators and exact phrase searches.
8. The search engine should provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. The search engine should have high availability and uptime, with minimal downtime.
2. The search engine should be scalable to handle increasing volumes of user queries and content.
3. The search engine should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from errors and failures.
4. The search engine should have low latency and provide search results quickly.
5. The search engine should be able to handle high levels of traffic and user activity.
6. The search engine should provide strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Assumptions:

1. The system assumes that users are authorized and authenticated to use the search engine.
2. The system assumes that web pages, images, videos, and news articles are publicly available and can be indexed by the search engine.
3. The system assumes that search queries and results are not confidential and can be stored in a database for analysis and auditing.

### Estimated Usage:

1. The search engine should be able to handle at least 100 million daily search queries.
2. The search engine should be able to index and store at least 50 billion web pages, 10 billion images, 1 billion videos, and 1 million news articles.
3. The search engine should be able to handle at least 1 million concurrent user queries.
