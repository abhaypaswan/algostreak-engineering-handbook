Design a web-based service that allows users to enter a long URL and get back a short URL that redirects to the original URL. The service should be able to handle a high volume of traffic and provide fast and reliable URL redirection.

### Example:

Input URL: **[https://www.example.com/blog/article/12345](https://www.example.com/blog/article/12345)**
Output URL: **[https://sho.rt/xyzabc](https://sho.rt/xyzabc)**

### Functional Requirements:

- Accept long URLs from users and generate unique short URLs
- Store the short URLs and their corresponding long URLs in a database
- Redirect users to the original long URL when they visit the short URL
- Handle multiple users and concurrent requests
- Provide an API for programmatic access to the URL shortening service

### Non-functional Requirements:

- High availability, with a target of 99.99% uptime
- Fast and reliable URL redirection, with a target latency of less than 100ms
- Secure and private, with no unauthorized access to URLs
- Scalable to handle high volumes of traffic and URLs
- Disaster recovery and backups for the database
- Support for multiple data centers for disaster recovery and global performance

### Assumptions:

- Each URL is less than 2048 bytes in size
- The service will handle up to 1 million URL shortening requests per day
- The service will handle up to 1000 requests per second during peak usage
- The service will store up to 100 million URLs

### Estimated Usage:

- 1 million URL shortening requests per day
- 1000 requests per second during peak usage
- 100 million URLs stored in the database
