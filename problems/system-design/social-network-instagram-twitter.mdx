Design a social network platform like Instagram, which allows users to share photos and videos with their followers, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and explore content through hashtags and search functions.

### Example:

Suppose we need to build a social network platform like Instagram for a messaging app with 50 million users. The platform should allow users to share photos and videos with their followers, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and explore content through hashtags and search functions. The platform should also include features like direct messaging and a newsfeed algorithm that displays relevant content to each user.

### Functional Requirements:

- Users should be able to create an account, set up a profile, and upload photos and videos to their profile.
- Users should be able to follow other users and view their posts on their newsfeed.
- Users should be able to like and comment on posts from other users.
- Users should be able to search for content using hashtags and keywords.
- Users should be able to send direct messages to other users.
- Users should be able to receive notifications for likes, comments, and direct messages.
- Users should be able to report and block other users for inappropriate behavior.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle larger volumes of users.
- The system should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from errors.
- The system should be able to run continuously with minimum downtime.
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of content uploads and downloads without impacting performance.
- The system should provide strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Assumptions:

- The system assumes that users are authenticated and authorized to use the service.
- The system assumes that users are not sharing inappropriate or offensive content.
- The system assumes that users are not engaging in any malicious behavior.

### Estimated Usage:

- The system should be able to handle at least 5 million daily active users.
- The system should be able to handle at least 1 million content uploads per hour.
