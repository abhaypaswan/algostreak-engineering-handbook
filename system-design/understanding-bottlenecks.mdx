Understanding bottlenecks is an important part of designing for scalability, as bottlenecks are the points in a system where performance is constrained and can limit the overall scalability of the system.

A bottleneck is a resource that is being used to its maximum capacity, and cannot handle any more traffic or demand. This means that even if other resources in the system have spare capacity, the overall system performance will be limited by the bottleneck.

### There are several types of bottlenecks that can occur in a system, including:

- CPU bottlenecks: when the CPU is the limiting factor in a system, and is unable to keep up with the demand for processing power.
- Memory bottlenecks: when the system is running out of memory, causing the system to slow down or crash.
- Disk I/O bottlenecks: when the system is reading and writing to disk too frequently, causing delays and slowing down the overall performance.
- Network bottlenecks: when the network is the limiting factor, and is unable to handle the amount of traffic or data being transmitted.
- Database bottlenecks: when the database is the limiting factor, and is unable to handle the amount of requests or data being stored.

### There are several things that can cause bottlenecks in a system:

- High traffic: when the system receives more traffic than it can handle, the system may become overwhelmed and start to slow down.
- Limited resources: when the system does not have enough resources (e.g. CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the workload, the system may become constrained and start to slow down.
- Inefficient code: when the code is not optimized or is overly complex, the system may take longer to process requests and may become constrained.
- Limited scalability: when the system is not designed to scale horizontally, it will have a limited capacity and may become constrained as the workload increases.

### To tackle bottlenecks, you can use several methods:

- Optimize the code: by optimizing the code, you can reduce the amount of processing required and improve the system's performance.
- Add more resources: by adding more resources (e.g. more CPU, memory, disk space), you can increase the system's capacity and improve its performance.
- Distribute the load: by distributing the load across multiple machines, you can ensure that no single machine is overwhelmed and improve the system's overall performance.
- Monitor and log: by monitoring the system's performance and usage, and logging key events, you can quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.

It is also worth noting that bottlenecks can change over time as the load on the system changes, so it's important to continually monitor the system and be prepared to make adjustments as necessary to maintain good scalability.
