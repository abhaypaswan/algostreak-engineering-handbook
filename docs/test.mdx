# Factory Method Design Pattern - Test

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates the object creation logic in a separate method, called the factory method, which is implemented by subclasses.

## Problem

Consider a scenario where you have a class hierarchy with a base class and multiple derived classes. You want to create objects of these derived classes, but you don't want to tightly couple your code to the concrete implementations. Additionally, you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to subclasses.

## Solution

The Factory Method design pattern suggests defining an interface or an abstract base class that declares the factory method. Each derived class then implements this factory method to create objects of their respective types. The client code calls the factory method to create objects, without knowing the specific class being instantiated.

## Example

Let's consider an example where we have a `Shape` base class and two derived classes: `Circle` and `Rectangle`. We want to create objects of these shapes using the Factory Method design pattern.

First, we define the `Shape` interface or abstract base class:
