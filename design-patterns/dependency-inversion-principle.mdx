The Dependency Inversion Principle is a design principle that states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions. This means that the design of a system should depend on abstractions, rather than on concrete implementations.

To follow the Dependency Inversion Principle in your design:

1. Identify the high-level and low-level modules in your system. The high-level modules are typically the ones that provide the overall functionality of the system, while the low-level modules are the ones that provide the specific implementation details.
2. Create abstractions for low-level modules.
3. Have high-level modules depend on abstractions.
4. Have low-level modules implement abstractions.

Here's an example that violates the Dependency Inversion Principle in Python:

```python
class FileSystem:
  def read_file(self, path):
    # code to read a file from the filesystem
    pass
  def write_file(self, path, data):
    # code to write a file to the filesystem
    pass

class BackupService:
  def __init__(self):
    self.file_system = FileSystem()

  def backup(self, data):
    # code to generate a backup file name
    self.file_system.write_file(backup_file_name, data)
```

This example violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because the **`BackupService`** class has a direct dependency on the **`FileSystem`** class. This means that any changes to the **`FileSystem`** class could potentially affect the **`BackupService`** class, and vice versa. This violates the principle, as it means that the high-level **`BackupService`** class depends on the low-level **`FileSystem`** class.

To fix this issue and follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can introduce an abstraction for the file system functionality. Here's the refactored implementation:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IFileSystem(ABC):
  @abstractmethod
  def read_file(self, path):
    pass

  @abstractmethod
  def write_file(self, path, data):
    pass

class FileSystem(IFileSystem):
  def read_file(self, path):
    # code to read a file from the filesystem
    pass
  def write_file(self, path, data):
    # code to write a file to the filesystem
    pass

class BackupService:
  def __init__(self, file_system: IFileSystem):
    self.file_system = file_system

  def backup(self, data):
    # code to generate a backup file name
    self.file_system.write_file(backup_file_name, data)
```

In this revised version of the system, the **`BackupService`** class depends on the **`IFileSystem`** interface rather than on the **`FileSystem`** class directly. This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, as it ensures that the high-level **`BackupService`** class does not depend on the low-level **`FileSystem`** class.

By introducing the abstraction, we have decoupled the **`BackupService`** class from the **`FileSystem`** class, making the system more flexible and easier to modify. If we need to change the way that the system reads and writes files, we can do so by modifying the **`FileSystem`** class without affecting the **`BackupService`** class. This allows us to add new features or make changes to the system without causing unintended consequences.

### However, this example still uses an object of the **`FileSystem`** class. Is this not a violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle?

No, using an object of the **`FileSystem`** class in the **`BackupService`** class does not necessarily violate the Dependency Inversion Principle. The key principle here is that the high-level module (in this case, the **`BackupService`** class) should depend on abstractions, rather than on concrete implementations.

In this example, the **`BackupService`** class is still using an object of the **`FileSystem`** class. However, the **`BackupService`** class is not directly depending on the **`FileSystem`** class. Instead, it is depending on the **`IFileSystem`** interface, which is implemented by the **`FileSystem`** class.

This means that the **`BackupService`** class is not tightly coupled to the **`FileSystem`** class. If we need to change the way that the system reads and writes files, we can do so by creating a new class that implements the **`IFileSystem`** interface and using that class instead of the **`FileSystem`** class. This allows us to make changes to the low-level **`FileSystem`** class without affecting the high-level **`BackupService`** class.
