Design principles in object-oriented design (OOD) are guidelines that help developers create software systems that are modular, scalable, and maintainable. These principles are based on the idea that objects in a system should be designed around real-world entities and should exhibit certain characteristics, such as encapsulation and polymorphism.

There are several design principles that are commonly used in OOD, including the SOLID Principle, the Dependency Inversion Principle, and the Composition Over Inheritance principle.

> These principles help developers create software systems that are easy to understand, modify, and extend, as well as ensure that the system is flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.

To better understand what design principles are, let's consider an example using the SOLID principles.

### SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym that refers to five principles of object-oriented design:

1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin as a way to help developers create software systems that are modular, scalable, and maintainable.

> In the upcoming articles, we will delve into each of the SOLID principles in more detail.
