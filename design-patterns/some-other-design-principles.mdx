There are many design principles that are used in software engineering, in addition to the SOLID principles. Here are a few examples:

1. Composition over Inheritance: This principle advises developers to favor composition, or the act of combining simpler entities to create more complex ones, over inheritance, or the act of creating a new class by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class.
2. Encapsulate What Varies: This principle advises developers to identify aspects of a system that are likely to change and encapsulate them, or enclose them within a class or module, in order to protect the rest of the system from changes.
3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): This principle advises developers to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): This principle advises developers to avoid duplication of code, as it can lead to maintenance issues and increased complexity.
5. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): This principle advises developers to only implement functionality when it is actually needed, rather than adding unnecessary features that may never be used.
6. Law of Demeter: This principle advises developers to design objects such that each object has only limited knowledge about other objects and communicates only with its immediate neighbors.
7. Separation of Concerns: This principle advises developers to divide a software system into distinct parts that handle specific concerns or tasks.
8. Loose Coupling: This principle advises developers to design systems such that components are loosely coupled, meaning that they are not heavily dependent on each other and can be modified or replaced without affecting the rest of the system.
9. High Cohesion: This principle advises developers to design systems such that components are highly cohesive, meaning that they have a single, well-defined purpose and work together effectively.

By following these principles, developers can create software systems that are more modular, scalable, and maintainable.
