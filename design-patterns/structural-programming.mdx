Structural programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes a top-down, step-by-step approach to problem-solving. It involves breaking a program down into smaller, more manageable pieces, or "structures," and then building up those structures to solve the problem at hand.

One of the key features of structural programming is the use of control structures, which allow the programmer to specify the order in which the various structures should be executed. There are three main types of control structures:

1. Sequential: These structures execute one piece of code after another in a specific order.
2. Selection: These structures allow the programmer to specify different paths of execution based on certain conditions. For example, an "if-else" statement allows the programmer to specify that a certain piece of code should be executed if a certain condition is met, and a different piece of code should be executed if the condition is not met.
3. Iteration: These structures allow the programmer to specify that a certain piece of code should be repeated a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is met. For example, a "for" loop allows the programmer to specify that a certain piece of code should be repeated a certain number of times, and a "while" loop allows the programmer to specify that a certain piece of code should be repeated until a certain condition is met.

One of the benefits of structural programming is that it allows for clear, logical organization of code. It also makes it easier for other programmers to understand and modify the code, as the various structures and control structures make the flow of the program more transparent.

Example:

```python
# prompt the user for a number
number = input("Enter a number: ")

# convert the number to an integer
number = int(number)

# initialize the factorial to 1
factorial = 1

# use a for loop to calculate the factorial
for i in range(1, number+1):
  factorial *= i

# print the result
print("The factorial of", number, "is", factorial)
```

This program first prompts the user for a number and converts it to an integer. It then initializes a variable called **`factorial`** to 1, which will be used to store the result of the factorial calculation.

Next, the program uses a **`for`** loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user (inclusive). On each iteration of the loop, the value of **`factorial`** is multiplied by the current value of **`i`**, which keeps track of the current number in the range.

After the loop has completed, the program prints the final value of **`factorial`**, which is the factorial of the number entered by the user.

### Drawbacks of Structural Programming

Structural programming is a useful programming paradigm that has been widely used for many years. However, like any programming approach, it has its limitations and drawbacks. Here are a few potential drawbacks of structural programming:

- Inflexibility: Because structural programming emphasizes a top-down, step-by-step approach to problem-solving, it can be inflexible when it comes to handling more complex, dynamic problems.
- Lack of reusability: Structural programs are often specific to a particular problem, which means they are not easily reusable in other contexts.
- Poor support for abstractions: Structural programming can be difficult to use when it comes to creating abstractions or encapsulating complex behavior, as it tends to focus on individual steps and procedures rather than broader concepts.
- Code complexity: As programs become more complex, the use of multiple control structures and nested structures can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain.

That being said, these drawbacks are not unique to structural programming, and many of them can be mitigated with good programming practices and a clear, logical design.
